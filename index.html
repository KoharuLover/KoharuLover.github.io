            <h2>Understanding Stress and How It Affects the Brain</h2>

            <h3>What is Stress?</h3>
            <p>
                Stress is your body's way of reacting to any kind of demand or challenge. It activates your “fight or flight” response, which can help in emergencies — but when it's constant, it can wear you down.
            </p>

            <h3>How Stress Affects the Brain</h3>
            <p>
                - The <strong>amygdala</strong> becomes more sensitive, making you feel fear and anxiety faster.<br />
                - The <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong> (which helps with decision-making and planning) weakens.<br />
                - The <strong>hippocampus</strong> (linked to memory) can shrink over time.
            </p>

            <h3>Common Symptoms of Stress</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Headaches, stomachaches, or fatigue</li>
                <li>Difficulty sleeping or concentrating</li>
                <li>Feeling irritable, sad, or nervous</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Early Awareness Helps</h3>
            <p>
                The earlier you notice stress building up, the easier it is to manage it. Keeping a stress journal, doing regular check-ins with yourself, or simply pausing during the day to breathe can make a difference.

            <h2>Practical Strategies to Strengthen Mental Resilience</h2>

            <h3>1. Healthy Habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Get 7-9 hours to restore brain function.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Even a walk or stretch can boost mood.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Choose whole foods like nuts, fruits, and greens to nourish your mind.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Mindfulness & Breathing</h3>
            <p>
                Practicing mindfulness helps you stay grounded in the present. Try "box breathing": Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold again for 4.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Journaling & Reframing Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Journaling helps you understand your emotions better. When negative thoughts arise, ask yourself: “Is this fact or fear?” Try replacing harsh self-talk with more supportive, realistic perspectives.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Limit Digital Overload</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Take regular breaks from social media.</li>
                <li>Use screen time tracking apps to manage your habits.</li>
                <li>Turn off notifications when studying or relaxing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Build a Resilient Morning Routine</h3>
            <p>
                Starting your day with calm, intentional habits builds momentum. Try journaling, drinking water, or stretching — even for 5 minutes.

            <h2>The Power of Social Support and Communication</h2>

            <h3>Why Support Matters</h3>
            <p>
                People with strong social support systems are less likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. Talking things out often gives you perspective, encouragement, and relief.
            </p>

            <h3>What Healthy Support Looks Like</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Friends or family who listen without judging</li>
                <li>Mentors who can guide you through challenges</li>
                <li>Peers who validate your feelings and show empathy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ways to Build Your Support Network</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check in regularly with friends and loved ones</li>
                <li>Join clubs, group activities, or volunteering programs</li>
                <li>Talk to a counselor or support hotline if you're struggling</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Helping Others Helps You</h3>
            <p>
                Being there for someone else can strengthen your own emotional resilience. Kindness, empathy, and connection build emotional strength in both directions.
            </p>

            <h3>Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h3>
            <p>
                Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness — it's a sign of courage and self-awareness. Therapists, teachers, friends, and even online communities can be valuable resources.
